      <h3 class="info-subheading">The Best Of</h3>
      <p class="info-text">Most Synthesis Naturals products include herbs from both the western and Chinese herb traditions as well as nutrients, specialty oils, and essential oils that are all focused on achieving maximum benefit. Formulation begins with lists of the top 5-10 herbs, nutrients and essential oils for target activity. Herbs are chosen for water or oil extraction to optimize the presence of active constituents. Ingredients are selected based on peer reviewed research where possible, and established herbal traditions where research is not yet availabe.</p>
      <h3 class="info-subheading">Densely Active</h3>
      <p class="info-text">Many other herbal creams and topicals are created by adding a small amount of an herbal extract to an existing base formula. In the case of a cream you end up with a product that is mostly water, oil and emulsifier, with only a tiny bit of actual active herb. With Synthesis Naturals products, every part that can be an active, is. The water component is all herbal extract, the oil components are likewise all herbal extracts (or small amounts of specialty oils with high nutrient values). This yields products that have more than double the amount of herbal actives available in most other products. As much as possible, each formula is designed so that nearly every ingredient is beneficial (and if not, they are necessary for the delivery or preservation of the actives).</p>

     <h2 class="info-heading">The Founder</h2>
     <p class="info-text">Hi! I'm Dr. Becky Andrews, I am a naturopahtic physician, acupuncturist, herbalist, bodyworker, gardener, cook, permaculture designer and avid mixologist. I have studied many herbal traditions and with many herbal teachers, both formally and informally. I am a graduate (and former faculty member) of Bastyr University and AOMA School for Integrative Medicine. I have been creating custom herbal formulations for 25 years.

I have always loved using herbs in the healing process, it feels like therapeutic art. I have often been frustrated by the lack of products that provided complete formulas. I often had people buying multiple products and mixing them together (plus adding herbal infusions of their own) to get the combinations we really wanted. The idea of this product line has been incubating in my imagination for many years, and I am happy to finally be making them available for you.</p>

  <h2 class="info-heading">The Products</h2>
  <p class="info-text">Synthesis Naturals products are hand made in small artisanal batches by Dr. Becky. Ingredients are selected and extracted with care for maximum benefit. Synthesis Naturals products are free of parabens, phthalates, petroleum products, animal products, corn, wheat, gluten, soy, formaldehyde, formaldehyde releasing preservatives, triclosan, synthetic fragrances or colors. Where possible organic ingredients have been sourced, and all herbs are from trusted herbal distributors.

Since many of the products contain water extracts of herbs, the use of strong preservatives is necessary (water + herbs = microbe feast). Great effort has been made to find a balance between the least toxic and most effective preservatives. All ingredients used are approved as "safe" by the EWG Skin Deep database for cosmetic ingredients.

Products have not been tested on any beings but myself, my friends, family and eager volunteers.</p>
